    **Parent Epic**: EPIC: M2 — Biome 1 event system (random events + outcomes)


    **Goal**

    Introduce replayable, seed-driven events that create meaningful choices and consequences
    during a run.


    **Scope / Tasks**

    - [ ] Pick the asset format (ScriptableObjects preferred unless content needs
    external editing).

    - [ ] Define schema + IDs (stable identifiers for save/load).

    - [ ] Add validation rules (duplicate IDs, missing refs, invalid ranges).

    - [ ] Create at least one example asset and load it at runtime.


    **Acceptance Criteria**

    - Work is data-driven where applicable (no hardcoded content).

    - No regressions to existing M1/M2 functionality.

    - Plays nicely with deterministic seed/replay expectations.


    **Definition of Done**

    - Implemented + tested in-editor (basic smoke test).

    - Docs or inline comments updated where it helps Future You™.

    **Acceptance Criteria**

    - Work is data-driven where applicable (no hardcoded content).

    - No regressions to existing M1/M2 functionality.

    - Plays nicely with deterministic seed/replay expectations.


    **Definition of Done**

    - [ ] Implement mitigation options (upgrade/item/behavior).

    - [ ] Add clear warnings to prevent ''unfair'' game-overs.

    - [ ] Ensure at least 2 events interact with hazard.


    **Acceptance Criteria**

    - Work is data-driven where applicable (no hardcoded content).
