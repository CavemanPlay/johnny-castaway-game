    body:
      goal: Introduce replayable, seed-driven events that create meaningful choices and consequences during a run.
      acceptance_criteria:
        - Event triggers are deterministic given seed + run state (same seed + same actions ⇒ same event sequence).
        - At least 8 events implemented with 2+ choices each (or 2 outcome branches).
        - Events can modify resources, hazard state, upgrades, or island features.
        - Event UI supports choice selection and shows result feedback.
        - Events are save/load safe (mid-event and post-event).
      in_scope:
        - Event scheduler (time/tick-based + probability weights).
        - Event definitions as data (ScriptableObjects or JSON).
        - Outcome resolver (resource deltas, flags, unlocks).
        - Basic event UI panel + notification hook.
      out_of_scope:
        - Advanced narrative writing polish.
        - Localization.
        - Cinematic cutscenes or voice acting.
